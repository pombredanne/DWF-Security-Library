# Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) Library Project

The Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) Library Project has a goal of finding
and cataloging the best security content available. This is not something
that is easy to do and will require the help of the greater security
community.

## Tracking content

For the moment we will use github to track the content. Given the enormity
of this task, finding a tool that can not only track the content, but also
have a suitably long life is non trivial. Rather than do nothing while
searching for a tool that likely doesn't exist, we will use a git
repository.

Long term we want to see something more capable to dealing with
this problem.

## Adding content to the library

Please submit a PULL request to the DWF library project to add or edit
existing content.

## Categories

We'll try to keep things arranged in categories. Feel free to add new
categories (one per file as needed).
